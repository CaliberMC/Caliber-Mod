Caliber Mod aims to add thousands of block variations to Vanilla Minecraft by adding numerous new building block shapes.  Caliber Mod is the Ultimate Vanilla+ builders mod.  Create fantastically detailed castles and landscapes with all of the new blocks and invite your friends to your one of a kind world!

This mod is being developed as a survival/vanilla friendly alternative to Conquest Reforged.
However, I can assure you that it doesn't have the weird quirks that make Conquest so hard to use in survival.  The mod is fully survival friendly with recipes and loot to boot!  I intend to stay on the Forge or NeoForge Mod loader for now but may add a Fabric version in the future.

**Caliber Mod 18.2 and 1.20.1 are not compatible.  Please do not update from 1.18.2 as your builds will be broken** _Going forward, all versions will be forward compatible from 1.20.1.  Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause._

## 

Keep in mind, this is a Beta and not all features have been added to the mod. Upon release of new versions, additional features will be added and I will do my best not to break anyexisting ones. Now that the mod is out of Alpha, most features included in the mod will be here to stay. I look forward to providing a bug free and highly useable survival friendly mod for everyone to use. If you have any ideas or feature suggestions please let me know in the comments or on the issues/feature request page on github.

Keep this mod bookmarked because it will be in development for a long time to come.
