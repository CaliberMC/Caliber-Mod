Caliber Mod aims to add thousands of block variations to Vanilla Minecraft. Everything from additional types of stone to 
numerous new building block shapes/types and decorations galore. Caliber Mod is the Ultimate Vanilla+ builders mod. 
Create fantastically detailed castles and landscapes with all of the new blocks and invite your friends to your one of 
a kind world!

This mod is being developed as a survival friendly alternative to Conquest Reforged and will take some time to be on par. 
However, I can assure you that the mod is fully survival friendly with world generation and recipes and loot! We also plan 
to stay on the Forge or NeoForge Mod loader for now but may add a Fabric version in the future. 1.18.2 will be completed 
first before porting forward to all future versions.

Keep in mind, this is an Alpha and not all features are currently working as intended. Upon release of new versions, 
several features including loot tables and recipes may be missing. Features could also change. I appreciate any feedback 
about missing textures, block behavior/blockstates not functioning properly etc. I look forward to providing a bug free 
and highly useable survival friendly mod for everyone to use. If you have any ideas or feature suggestions please let 
me know in the comments or on the issues/feature request page on github.

Keep this mod bookmarked because it will be in development for a long time to come.
